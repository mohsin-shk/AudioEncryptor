# XOR-Based Audio Encryption System

![XOR-Based Audio Encryption](insert_link_to_project_image_here)

## Overview

The XOR-Based Audio Encryption System is a Python application designed to provide secure audio file encryption and decryption using a user-provided secret key. This project combines audio file processing, XOR encryption, and a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter to create an accessible and powerful tool for securing audio data.

## Features

- **User-Friendly GUI:** The application offers an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to easily select input audio files, specify encryption keys, and choose output locations for encrypted files.

- **XOR Encryption:** The core encryption algorithm employs XOR bitwise operations to encrypt and decrypt audio files. This process ensures data security through the use of a secret key.

- **Secure Key Management:** Users can specify their encryption keys, providing an additional layer of security to protect their audio data. Default key values can be set as needed.

- **Input Validation:** The application includes input validation to ensure that users select valid input audio files, preventing potential errors during the encryption process.

- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling and informative error messages are integrated to guide users through any issues that may arise during encryption or decryption.

- **File Browsing:** Convenient file browsing options allow users to easily locate input audio files and specify output file locations, streamlining the encryption process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for the GUI)
- OS module (for file operations)

### Usage

1. Launch the application.

2. Select an input audio file by clicking the "Browse" button next to "Select Input File."

3. Enter your encryption key in the "Enter Encryption Key" field. (You can use the default key or specify your own.)

4. Choose an output file location by clicking the "Browse" button next to "Select Output File."

5. Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the audio file or "Decrypt" to decrypt it.

6. If successful, a message will confirm the operation's completion.

### Installation

No installation is required. Simply run the Python script `Audio_Encryption_XOR.py` to launch the application.

```bash
python audio_encryption.py
